# fengraodistance-Arfs


The file `divisors.g` contains functions to compute the generalized Feng-Rao distances of a numerical semigroup.

The file `FR2Arf.g` contains functions to compute the second Feng-Rao distance and number for Arf numerical semigroups. 

The code follows the algorithms presented in [arXiv:1702.08225](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08225)
