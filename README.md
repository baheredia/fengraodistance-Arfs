# fengraodistance-Arfs


The file `divisors.g` contains functions to compute the generalized Feng-Rao distances of a numerical semigroup.

The file `FR2Arf.g` contains a function to compute the first and second Feng-Rao distances, and the second Feng-Rao number for of the elements in an Arf numerical semigroup greater than the conductor. 

The file `towers.g` can be used to produce numerical semigroups associated to Garcia-Stichtenoth

The code follows the algorithms presented in [arXiv:1702.08225](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08225)
